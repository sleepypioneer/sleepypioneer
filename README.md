### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**sleepypioneer/sleepypioneer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Ecosia.org (the search engine which plants trees) & lagreenceramics.co.uk
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning intermediate python & GO
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that empower and amplify the voices of margonalised groups
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with leveling up as a developer
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about supporting those from non traditional backgrounds
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: DM me on Twitter my handle is sleepypioneer or find me in the pyladies slack as Jessica Greene
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be a coffee roaster and before that a camera assitant for television, and I once served coffee to the late Sir Christopher Lee!
